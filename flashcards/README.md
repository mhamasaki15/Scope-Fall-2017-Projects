# React Native Flashcard App

Built for Lesson 2 of Scope Fall 2017.

## Basic Required Functionality
- Displays a set of flashcards, each with a term and a definition.
- Tapping on a flashcard changes what it displays (term/definition)
- Clicking on "Add Card" opens a modal that allows the user to add a card to the set.

## Additional Functionality
- Allows for the shuffling of cards.
- Each card can now be removed from the set by clicking the "X" on the card.
- Fixed an issue where the "Add Card" confirmation was hidden by the keyboard. Now, tapping off of the textbox will close the keyboard.
